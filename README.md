# minishell

This is our own little shell made in C. You can run the compilation using "make" and then execute ./minishell

It's based on bash you can try all sorts of commands, with redirections ">" "<" "<<" ">>", pipes "|", and even our 7 builtins: cd, pwd, env, export, unset, echo and exit.
Enjoy!
